# Overview
The SpriteExporter script is a Unity Editor tool designed to Export sliced sprites from a specified Texture2D into individual PNG files. This can be particularly useful for extracting and saving individual sprites from a Sprite Sheet.

## How to Use
* Ensure the SpriteExporter script is placed in the **Assets** folder within your Unity project.

* Ensure that the **Read/Write** property of the texture is enabled and the TextureType property of the texture is **Sprite (2D and UI)**.

* In the Unity Editor, Right-click the Sprite Sheet PNG file in the Project view, then select **SpriteExporter > ExportFromSpriteSheet**. The individual sprites will be exported to the ExportedSprites folder located in the same directory as the original file.
